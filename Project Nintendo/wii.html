          <p>In 2006, Nintendo released a video game console called Nintendo Wii. Wii competes with Playstation 3 by
            Sony and Xbox 360 by Microsoft. It is stated by Nintendo that this console focuses broader demographic when
            compared to its previous versions. Wii consists of advanced features when comparing to previous consoles.
            Primary wireless controller is used as handheld pointing device as well as detects three dimensions
            movements. Its WiiConnect24 feature allows users to receive updates and messages over internet even when it
            is in standby mode. Moreover, it is among the first consoles to provide Virtual Console service that helps
            in selecting emulated games that can be downloaded from past systems.</p>
          <p>The release information was announced by Nintendo on 14th September, 2006 for North America, South America,
            Europe, Asia, and Japan. On 26th April, 2008, Wii was introduced in South Korea and on 12 July, 2008, Wii
            was launched in Taiwan. Earlier 21 games had been announced and another 12 were added when the console was
            finally released in 2006. The console bundle included Wii Sports in all places except in South Korea and
            Japan. After the launch, monthly sales were calculated that came out to be higher than the competitors of
            Nintendo Wii. In United States, the sale has surpassed the sale of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In Japanese
            market, the lead was much higher.</p>
          <p>On 12th September, 2007, it was reported by Financial Times that the sale of Wii had surpassed Xbox 360
            sale and was the market leader in sales of home-console for current generation. Wii is the second best
            selling console game in Japan and US as per Enterbrain and NPD Group. Nintendo had announced Wii successor
            as Wii U in 2011. It will feature a controller having high-definition graphics output and embedded touch
            screen. Nunchuk, balance board, and Wii remote are compatible with the Wii U game. On November 18th 2012,
            Wii U was released in North America and then on 30th November 2012, it was released in Australia and Europe
            and finally on 8th December, 2012, it was released in Japan.</p>
          <p>The dimensions of redesigned Wii have similar dimensions when compared to the original model. It is
            designed for horizontal sitting but is not compatible with the Nintendo accessories and Nintendo GameCube.
            On 7th December, 2012 Wii mini was launched in Canada. It was a redesigned, smaller version of Wii that
            lacked GameCube compatibility, SD card slot, online gaming, and Wi-Fi support. This console only supports
            the Composite video output but does not supports Component video or S-Video cables. There is just one USB
            port in the mini version whereas the original Wii had 2 USB ports. The styling of Wii mini is done in red
            border and matte black that includes red Wii Remote Plus as well as Nunchuk without pack-in game. Power
            adapter, sensor bar, and composite cable are also included. The release date of this version has not been
            announced for many countries. Nintendo Wii is the smallest home console that measures 44 mm wide, 215.4 mm
            deep, and 157 mm tall with slightly bigger than 3 DVD cases.</p>
