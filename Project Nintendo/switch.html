          <p>The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo, released worldwide in most regions on
            March 3, 2017. It is a hybrid console that can be used as a home console and portable device. Its wireless
            Joy-Con controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and
            tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. They can also
            connect to a Grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad form, or be used individually in
            the hand like the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software
            supports online gaming through Internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with
            other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical flash-based ROM cartridges
            and digital distribution via Nintendo eShop; the system has no region lockout. A handheld-focused revision
            of the system, called the Nintendo Switch Lite, was released on September 20, 2019.</p>
          <p>The Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename NX, the concept
            of the Switch came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014,
            attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and market competition from mobile gaming.
            Nintendo's then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The
            Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of
            use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia's Tegra
            line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game
            engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library,
            Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers to help build out the
            Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many independent video game
            studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from
            first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.</p>
          <p>As an eighth-generation console, the Nintendo Switch competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's
            PlayStation 4. The console shipped nearly three million in the first month of its launch, exceeding
            Nintendo's initial projection of two million, and within a year of release achieved over 14 million units
            sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the
            fastest-selling home console in both Japan and the United States. As of December 2019, the Nintendo Switch
            and Switch Lite have sold more than 52 million units worldwide. Switch sales have been strongly tied to
            sales of Nintendo's first-party titles, with six games, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash
            Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Pokémon: Let's Go and Pokémon Sword and Shield
            having sold over ten million units each.</p>
